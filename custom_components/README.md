# Custom components

* [HACS](https://hacs.netlify.com) for intalling, updating, and finding new custom integrations. All other custom integrations are installed using this.
* [Circadian lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting/) since the built in [flux integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/flux) isn't as good.
* [Home Assistant Remote](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote) for linking my Z-Wave and primary instances. This is more effective than my ugly MQTT hack.
