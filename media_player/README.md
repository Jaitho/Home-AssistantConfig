# Media players

## Google Cast

The [Google Cast](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.cast/) devices, both Chromecast and Google Home

## Plex

I don't really use [this component](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.plex/) for automations, or interact with it in any way currently

## Samsung TV

This [component](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.samsungtv/) is mostly used so I can detect when the TV is on, and control the volume.

## Sonos

I use the [Sonos component](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.sonos/) for various automations, both as a music player, and as a TTS destination.

## Squeezebox

Yes, I have some of the old [Squeezebox](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.squeezebox/) Radio units, from back when Logitech bought Slimdevices, and before they shut it all down. While almost impossible to find these days, they're still the best smart bedside alarm/media player devices I've found.
