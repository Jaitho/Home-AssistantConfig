# Scenes

Component: [scene](https://home-assistant.io/components/scene/)

## All lights off

Well, it's not really since it doesn't include the bedroom lights (deliberately), or the light for the house number. This as it says turns all the (other) lights off.

This we use in the "everybody's away" automation, to ensure that all the lights are off if we're not home.

## Bedtime

This turns off the same set of lights, but also the TVs. Don't actually use it.

## Lounge lights

Two scenes, for on and off. We use the on scene as part of the arriving home automation.
